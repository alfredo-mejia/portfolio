This repository contains my personal portfolio.

I built this project to have a single place that reflects my work, interests, and projects without having to manually keep everything in sync. Instead of being a static website, the portfolio is designed to grow as I add new projects, write new posts, or update my experience.

The site is organized into a few main sections:
- Home / Landing: A simple starting point that helps visitors quickly find what they’re looking for.
- My Story: A narrative page that shares my background and some of the experiences that shaped my interests and motivation.
- My Resume: A living resume that presents my experience in a clear, readable way and can also generate a clean, downloadable resume when needed.
- My Blogs: A writing space for things I’m learning, ideas I’m exploring, and topics I find interesting. Posts may be technical or non-technical, but are meant to be useful, concise, and easy to read.
- My Projects: An automated view of my GitHub projects, focused on showing real work rather than manually curated descriptions.

A key goal of this project is to avoid duplicated work and manual updates. The resume lives in one place and can be exported when needed, and projects are pulled directly from GitHub. When I update a project or write something new, the portfolio updates automatically.

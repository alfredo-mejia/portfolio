# Product Name

Alfredo's Portfolio

*A living portfolio and personal knowledge space*

(Short, intentional, and personal. The product is you.)

# Vision Statement

To create a living, evolving portfolio that authentically represents who Alfredo is as a person and as a software engineer---showcasing not just finished work, but growth, curiosity, thinking patterns, and end-to-end ownership---while minimizing manual upkeep and maximizing clarity for any visitor.

# Background & Context

Alfredo is a software engineer with over four years of professional experience, primarily working in a long-lived, mature C++ codebase. This portfolio exists to provide space for deliberate exploration, reflection, and ownership---things that are often constrained by long-lived production environments. This is a deliberate environment where Alfredo can design systems, tell his story, and demonstrate growth.

# Target Users / Customers

## Primary Users

- Recruiters seeking a holistic understanding of Alfredo
- Hiring managers evaluating technical depth and thinking
- Engineers interested in how Alfredo approaches problems and learning

## Secondary Users

- Alfredo himself, as a personal archive and reflection tool
- Curious visitors who want to explore ideas, writing, or projects

Each user should be able to immediately navigate to what they care about most. While multiple audiences may visit the site, the experience is primarily designed for recruiters and hiring managers, with other users benefiting from the same clarity and structure.

# Problem Statement

Traditional portfolios:

- Flatten engineers into bullet points
- Require constant manual updates
- Emphasize claims over proof
- Fail to show how someone thinks or grows

Additionally, many portfolios become stale because they are separate from the engineer's actual work and learning process.

This product solves the problem of how to present a complete, evolving professional identity without duplicating effort or losing authenticity.

The core problem is not visibility, but *representation*---how to show real thinking and growth without duplicating effort or performing for an audience.

# Product Description

This product is a multi-page portfolio composed of four core experiences, each serving a distinct purpose while remaining interconnected:

## Home / Landing Page

A simple, intentional entry point that allows visitors to immediately choose where they want to go:

- My Story
- My Resume
- My Blogs
- My Projects

The page prioritizes clarity and direction over content density.

## My Story Page

A scroll-driven narrative that answers:

"Who is Alfredo, and why should I care?"

This page presents Alfredo's life and growth as a story rather than a list of facts. It follows a timeline from birth through education and professional life, highlighting key events that shaped his identity, curiosity, motivations, struggles, and aspirations.

Each moment includes:

- A short, purposeful text segment
- A corresponding visual metaphor representing growth or change

Visitors can toggle between:

- Story Mode (immersive, animated, narrative-driven)
- Plain Mode (static, text-focused, recruiter-friendly)

## My Resume Page

A living, expandable resume that answers:

"Can I clearly understand Alfredo's experience, and can I easily download a clean resume?"

The web page is the source of truth and contains:

- Summary
- Experience with expanded context and impact
- Skills
- Education
- Selected projects

From this page, visitors can generate one-page, recruiter-friendly PDF resumes. These PDFs are views of the web resume, not separate documents.

Key characteristics:

- Multiple export modes (e.g., backend-focused, mobile-focused, web-focused)
- Emphasis and summarization derived only from content already on the page
- Ability to track when resumes were generated to signal freshness

## My Blogs Page

A personal writing and thinking space that answers:

- How does Alfredo think?
- What interests him?
- What is he learning or reflecting on?

Blog posts may include:

- Technical topics
- Personal projects
- Reflections on books, documentaries, or learning experiences
- Explorations of ideas in math, science, or technology

Content is intentionally non-controversial and focused on being useful, readable, and concise.

Blog features include:

- Writing directly on the site
- Importing from Markdown or Org files
- Rich content (code blocks, diagrams, PDFs, screenshots, handwritten notes)
- Versioning
- Categorization and tagging
- Search by date, modification time, and topic
- Reading time, difficulty level, last updated indicator
- Optional text-to-speech for accessibility

## My Projects Page

A project showcase that answers:

"Can Alfredo actually build things end-to-end?"

This page mirrors Alfredo's GitHub repositories rather than being manually curated. Only selected repositories are surfaced, but once included, they are automatically maintained.

Each project includes:

- A live, runnable version (when applicable)
- A cleanly rendered README
- A short project summary
- Automatically surfaced insights such as languages used or key concepts

Projects can be filtered or explored via tags defined within the repositories themselves.

The core philosophy:

**Updating the git repository automatically updates the portfolio.**

# Value Proposition

# Differentiation / Positioning

This portfolio is differentiated by:
